    [00:00.0] <h1>Taking the Five Precepts</h1>
    <h3>from the Metta Forest Monastery</h3>

    The Request: Mayaṃ bhante, ti-saraṇa saha pañca sīlāni yācāma.

      Venerable Sir, we request the Three Refuges & The Five Precepts.

    Dutiyam-pi mayaṁ bhante...

      Venerable Sir, a second time...

    Tatiyam-pi mayaṁ bhante...

      Venerable Sir, a third time...


    The monk then recites the following passage three times, after which the lay people repeat it three times:

    Namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammā-sambuddhassa.

      Homage to the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the Rightly Self-awakened One.


    The monk then recites the following passage line by line, with the lay people reciting line by line after him:

    Buddhaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi.

      I go to the Buddha for refuge.

    Dhammaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi.

      I go to the Dhamma for refuge.

    Saṅghaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi.

      I go to the Saṅgha for refuge.

    Dutiyam-pi buddhaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi.

      A second time, I go to the Buddha for refuge.

    Dutiyam-pi dhammaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi.

      A second time, I go to the Dhamma for refuge.

    Dutiyam-pi saṅghaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi.

      A second time, I go to the Saṅgha for refuge.

    Tatiyam-pi buddhaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi.

      A third time, I go to the Buddha for refuge.

    Tatiyam-pi dhammaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi.

      A third time, I go to the Dhamma for refuge.

    Tatiyam-pi saṅghaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi.

      A third time, I go to the Saṅgha for refuge.


    The monk then says: Ti-saraṇa-gamanaṁ niṭṭhitaṁ.

      This ends the going for refuge.

    The lay people respond: Āma bhante.

      Yes, Venerable Sir.


    The monk then recites the precepts line by line, with the lay people reciting them line by line after him.
