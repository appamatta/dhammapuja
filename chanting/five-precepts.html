    [00:00.0] <h1>Taking the Five Precepts</h1>
    <h3>from the Metta Forest Monastery</h3>
    <hr />
    The Request: Mayaṃ bhante, ti-saraṇa saha pañca sīlāni yācāma.

      Venerable Sir, we request the Three Refuges & The Five Precepts.

    Dutiyaṃ pi mayaṁ bhante...

      Venerable Sir, a second time...

    Tatiyaṃ pi mayaṁ bhante...

      Venerable Sir, a third time...


    The monk then recites the following passage three times, after which the lay people repeat it three times:

    Namo tassa bh`agav`ato arah`ato s^ammās^ambuddh`assa.

      Homage to the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the Rightly Self-awakened One.


    The monk then recites the following passage line by line, with the lay people reciting line by line after him:

    Buddhaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi.

      I go to the Buddha for refuge.

    Dhammaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi.

      I go to the Dhamma for refuge.

    Saṅghaṁ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi.

      I go to the Saṅgha for refuge.

    Dutiyaṃ pi Buddhaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi.

      A second time, I go to the Buddha for refuge.

    Dutiyaṃ pi Dhammaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi.

      A second time, I go to the Dhamma for refuge.

    Dutiyaṃ pi Saṅghaṁ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi.

      A second time, I go to the Saṅgha for refuge.

    Tatiyaṃ pi Buddhaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi.

      A third time, I go to the Buddha for refuge.

    Tatiyaṃ pi Dhammaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi.

      A third time, I go to the Dhamma for refuge.

    Tatiyaṃ pi Saṅghaṁ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi.

      A third time, I go to the Saṅgha for refuge.


    The monk then says: Ti-saraṇa-gamanaṁ niṭṭhitaṁ.

      This ends the going for refuge.

    The lay people respond: Āma bhante.

      Yes, Venerable Sir.


    The monk then recites the precepts line by line, with the lay people reciting them line by line after him.
