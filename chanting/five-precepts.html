    [00:01.0] The Request: Mayaṃ/ahaṃ bhante, ti-saraṇa s`aha pañca s^īlāni y`ācāma.

      Venerable Sir, we/I request the Three Refuges & The Five Precepts.

      H^om^age to t`he B`lessed One, N^oble, the Rightly Self-awakened One.


    The monk then recites the following passage line by line, with the lay people reciting line by line after him:
