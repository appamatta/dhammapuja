      [00:00.0] # Karaṇīya Mettā Sutta (Eng.)
      [00:01.0] ## The Discourse on Goodwill
      [00:02.0] ###<i>from the Abhayagiri Forest Monastery</i>
      <hr />

      (Now let us chant the Buddha’s words on loving-k`indness.)
      [This is what should b`e done]
      By one wh`o is sk^illed in g`oodness
      And who knows the p`ath of peace:
      Let them b`e able and ^upright,
      Str`aightforward and gentl^e `in speech,
      Humble and not conc`eited,
      C`ontented and ^easily s`atisfied,
      Unburdened with d`uties and frugal ^in th`eir ways.
      Peaceful and calm, `and wise and sk^illful,
      N`ot proud and dem^anding in n`ature.
      Let them _not_ d`o the sl^ight`est thing
      That th`e wise would lat^er r`eprove,
      Wishing: In gladness `and in s^afety,
      May `all beings b^e `at ease.
      Whatever liv`ing beings there m`ay be,
      Whether th`ey are w^eak `or strong, om`itting none,
      The great or the m`ighty, medium, sh^ort, `or small,
      The seen and the `unseen,
      Those living near and f^ar `away,
      Those born and t`o b^e born,
      May `all beings b^e `at ease.
      Let none dec``eive `an`other
      Or d`espise a`ny being in ^a`ny state.
      Let n_o_ne through anger or `ill-will
      Wish h^arm upon an`other.
      Even as `a moth_e_r protects with h`er life
      Her child, her `onl^y child,
      S_o_ with a b^oundless heart
      Should `one cherish all l^iv`ing beings,
      Radiating k^indn_ess_ over th`e ent^ir`e world:
      Spreading upwards to the sk^ies
      And d`ownw`ards t`o th^e depths,
      Outwards and unb`ounded,
      Fr`eed from h^atr^ed and `ill-will.

      Whether standing or w`alking, seated or l^y`ing down,
      Free from dr`owsiness,
      One should s`ustain this r`ecoll^ection.
      This is said t`o b_e_ th`e subl^ime ab`iding.
      By not holding to f`ixed views,
      Th`e pure-h^eart`ed one, having clarity of v`ision,
      Being freed fr`om all s^ense-desires,
      Is not b^orn ^again int`o this world.
