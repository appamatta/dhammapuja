## Credits


This site is heavily derived from [John Nishinaga's](https://ejinjue.org/john/) ['Dhamma Schtuff'](https://pali.ejinjue.org/) project. I would like to take this opportunity to thank John for providing this excellent resource to make Dhamma study/practice easier and more enjoyable.

## What does Dhammapuja mean?
```
Pūjā : (1) honour, respect, homage, (2) worship,
devotional observances, devotional offerings; also
offerings to monks.

(1) The Mahā-mangala Sutta (Sn. 259) says that
“Honour and respect towards those worthy of it, is
conducive to great blessing” ( pūjā ca pūjaniyesu etaṃ mangalam uttamaṃ ). See Dhp. 195f.

(2) The Buddha did not think much of mere outer
worship. “Not thus, Ananda, is the Tathāgata respected,
venerated, esteemed, worshipped and honoured in the
highest degree. But, Ananda, whatsoever bhikkhu or
bhikkhuni, lay man or lay woman, abides by the
Teaching, lives uprightly in the Teaching, walks in the
way of the Teaching, it is by him that the Tathāgata is
respected, venerated, esteemed, worshipped and
honoured in the highest degree” (D. 16). – “There are
two kinds of worship: in a material way ( āmisa-pūjā )
and through ( practice of ) the Dhamma ( dhamma-pūjā ).
The worship through ( practice of ) the Dhamma is the
better of the two” ( A. II ).
